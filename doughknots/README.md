# Codeschool 1-3 Hour Crash Course - Build a Webpage

This Crash Course is intended to show students the basic HTML and CSS necessary for building a simple website. Students will learn about page layout and design while coding up a simple one page site about a fictional donut shop called: Le DoughKnot Shoppe.

## Starter Files for Students

In `starter_files.zip`, you will find all the files a student will need to begin the course:

* index.html
* js/main.js
* css/style.css
* css/normalize.css
* img/<donut images!>

`index.html` and `style.css` are left partially empty. These files are where the class will spend its time working up the design. The HTML and CSS are a little old school, but intended to work on all devices.

`main.js` is left completely empty. This is an optional task for classes that are strongly engaged and are capable of taking a little dip into javaScript interactions using jQuery.

The `demo` folder contains the final version of all files that the students will write during the course. Please review the site and code before giving this crash course.

## Coursework

The documents contained in the `build_a_website` folder are intended to for the TIYO crash course `Codeschool 1-3 Hour Crash Course - Build a Website`. Please direct students to that crash course so that they can use the lessons and exercises contained there.

## Lesson Plan

Lesson Plans and Lecture notes can be found in final unit of the Crash Course on TIYO entitles `Instructor Resources`
